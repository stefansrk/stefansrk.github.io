<b>Details:</b>

<p>Making informed decisions about complex and adaptive systems is extremely difficult. An even more difficult problem is disseminating information in large and complex agent societies. For instance, a seemingly small change in a government’s policy can trigger unpredicted or undesirable effects on a societal level. Similarly, the communication of such a policy change can impact societies even before the policy is implemented.</p>

<p>One way to understand what to do and how to communicate in large and complex societies is to model these kinds of social phenomena using agent-based models (ABMs). An agent-based model (ABM) is a computational model for simulating the actions and interactions of autonomous agents (both individual or collective entities such as organizations or groups, and both humans and machines) in order to understand the behaviour of a system and what governs its outcomes. It combines elements of game theory, complex systems, emergence, computational sociology, multi-agent systems, evolutionary programming, and cognitive modelling.</p>

<p>This project will focus on various uses of ABMs for understanding social phenomena, on facilitating the use of such ABMs with user-friendly dashboards and visualisations, and on designing dialogue systems to explain the dynamics of such ABMs to non-AI experts.</p>

<p>In this project you are expected to mainly do the following things:</p>

<ul>
<li> 1. Perform background research on the topic chosen. </li>
<li> 2. A) Implement and evaluate an ABM, or B) design and implement a user-friendly dashboard to run various evolutionary ABMs, or C) design and implement a dialogue system to help understand or explain ABM dynamics. </li>
<li> 3. Write a report to describe your project.</li>
<li> 4. Communicate your project in a short video.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of topics could include, but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>

<li> 1. Modelling dishonesty in hybrid societies, as in [1]. </li>
<li> 2. Modelling communication between different types of AI agents, as in [2].</li>
<li> 3. Modelling various types of problems similar to the Tragedy of The Commons. See [3,4] </li>
<li> 4. Modelling the adoption and impact of various AI technologies by societies with different political, economic or value systems. </li>
<li> 5. Designing and evaluating a user-friendly dashboard for running evolutionary ABMs. </li>
<li> 6. Designing new ways for agents to learn each other`s behaviour. See foundations of social learning [5]. </li>
<li> 7. Designing an agent-based dialogue system for evaluating explanations of multi-agent dynamics. See [6,7]. </li>
